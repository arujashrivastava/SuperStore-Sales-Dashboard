# SuperStore-Sales-Dashboard
Objective: 
The main goal of this project was to create an interactive and insightful dashboard for a supermarket's sales data. The dashboard was designed to help business stakeholders make data-driven decisions to enhance sales performance, improve efficiency, and increase customer satisfaction.

Key Features:

KPI Tracking: The dashboard included key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, sales by category, sales by region, and customer demographics to provide a comprehensive view of the supermarket's performance.

Time Series Analysis: Utilized time series analysis to track sales trends over different periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), allowing for accurate sales forecasting and trend identification.

Interactive Visualizations: Implemented interactive charts, graphs, and slicers in Power BI to enable users to filter and drill down into specific data points for detailed analysis. This interactive approach facilitated better understanding and exploration of sales patterns.

Data Quality and Insights: Focused on ensuring data quality and integrity by integrating and cleansing data from various sources. The dashboard provided actionable insights by highlighting areas for improvement and identifying opportunities for strategic growth.

Technologies and Tools Used:

Power BI: Used for creating interactive visualizations, dashboards, and reports.

Data Modeling: Applied data modeling techniques to structure data efficiently for analysis.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized DAX for custom calculations and measures to enhance the analytical capabilities of the dashboard.

Impact:

The project enabled supermarket management to make informed decisions based on real-time data insights, contributing to optimized inventory management, improved customer service, and increased sales.
